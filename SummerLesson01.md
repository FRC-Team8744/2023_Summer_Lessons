* What type of variable would you use for a wheel diameter measurement?

## Coding Exercise 1 - Autonomous mode!
1. Connect to your Romi, start the simulation, and trigger the Autonomous routine.
2. Which routine just ran?  How do you change it to another routine?
3. Create a new SequentialCommandGroup command called "AutonomousMaze" and add it to the list of options.
4. Copy the commands from AutonomousDistance into AutonomousMaze.
5. Change something, and verify that the robot does it.

## Coding Exercise 2 - Maze runner Autonomous
1. Follow the blue line on the floor with your robot using the joystick.
2. Re-write AutonomousMaze using DriveDistance and TurnDegrees commands.
3. Adjust your code so that it follows the line as closely as possible.
4. When you can stop the robot at the end of the line - turn around and drive back to the start.
5. The person who can end up closest to the start point wins!
